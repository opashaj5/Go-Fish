# Go Fish!
---
## Concept:

Go Fish is a fun and simple card game. It's player vs. the computer. The objective is to get the most 4-of-a-kind matches resulting in the highest score. Each player is dealt 7 cards from a deck of 52 cards. The remaining cards are placed face down as a draw pile in the center. The player has the upper hand and gets to go first. The player and opponent take turns asking one another if they have a specific card. If the opponent does not have the card number the player asked for, the opponent will say “Go Fish”. At this point, the player draws a card from the draw pile. If the card drawn matches the card number that was asked for, it becomes part of the players hand, and they continue with their turn. If the card does not match the card number that was asked for, the card becomes part of the players hand, and it is the opponent’s turn. The game ends when there are no cards left. The player with the most sets of four wins the game.
